          My name is Juan Ayala and I have been living my entire life in Redwood City.
          I am the youngest of four and the only boy in the family (aside from my father, of course).
          I am graduating Sequoia High School and will be attending UC Santa Cruz - GO Banana Slugs!
          I really enjoy playing any type of games, from video to board. I love swimming and singing in the shower, and
          my friends consider me a radio since I sing so many songs (even though I am not the best at it).
          When I'm not doing high school things (It's all over! YAY...except...there still is college),
          I chill with my family or friends, or play video games. My favorite color is blue. I play the saxophone.
          Vanilla is my favorite ice cream flavor. I enjoy scary movies. Peanut butter cookies -- duh BEST.
          I do not like chocolate and I hate traffic.

          Hi, I'm Thu! I'm from San Jose, and I'm a graduate of KIPP San Jose Collegiate. I'll be going to UC Berkeley this fall of 2016
          as a Computer Science major in the College of Letters and Sciences. I'm a major foodie, and I love trying all the
          latest food places in my neighborhood -- especially the boba cafes! My favorite flavors are lychee, strawberry,
          mango, and peach (I highly recommend them)! I cry when I see puppies (called "Dooglers" on the Google campus), which is pretty fun.
          I really love playing the piano, I crack lots of lame jokes, and I love meeting new people,
          so it's really nice to meet you all!
          <br>
          Fun Fact: I have tiny hands!﻿

          Hi everyone! I'm Megan. I'm a born and raised San Francisco native and I absolutely love my city.
          Other things I love: writing, dogs, my friends, good comedy, and exploring new places. Next year I'll
          be majoring in Computer Science at Harvard. Ultimately, I'd like to find a career that meets at the intersections
          of comp sci, language, and education (maybe even a career at Google!)
          <br>
          Fun Fact: I can solve a Rubik's cube
